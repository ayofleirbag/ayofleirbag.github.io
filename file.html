<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I was born on 6th July 2001 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. I studied primary education at Love Care Education Children's School from 2003 to 2013. During that period I participated much on swimming and excelled much on the sport and became the best swimmer in the school. I later studied my secondary education at St Joseph Millennium Secondary School from 2014 to 2020 where I completed and received an Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education. During my time at secondary school I held the Assistant Dormitory Prefect from 2015 to 2016 and received a certificate of leadership.</p>
<h2>My Current Activities</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Information Technology at the University of Dar es Salaam. I enrolled at programme because it has some contribution to the profession I am pursuing of becoming a technical analyst of the financial markets. My favourite course in this programme is Principles of Macroeconomic since it describes how the economics of countries move the financial markets especially the foreign exchange market. I am a self-sponsored student because my parents pay for my tuition fees,accommodation and other University fees together with  with pocket money.</p>
<h2>My Future Goals</h2>
<p>My career goals include becoming a technical analyst at the largest brokerage firm and later on with sufficient capital become an investor in the stock markets, digital assets, ecommerce, agriculture and real estate properties.</p>
